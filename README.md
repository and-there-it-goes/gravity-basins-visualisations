# Gravity Basins visualisations

Visualisations for gravity basin patterns (patterns formed by plotting the final point of a particle spawned into a space containing 3 zero-size gravitational bodies with a small amount of drag), inspired by [2swap](https://github.com/2swap)'s video, [༄ GRAVITY BASINS ࿐](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LavXSS5Xtbg).
